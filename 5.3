Missing values are considered a problem when cleaning genomics data. Explain.
In genomics, missing data can distort statistical analysis,
 reduce the power of findings, and lead to biased results.
 Genomic data is often high-dimensional, 
so even small gaps can significantly affect the accuracy of gene associations
