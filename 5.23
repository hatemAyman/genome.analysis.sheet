1. Read the data into an R object named students


students <- read.table("path/to/your/file.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

Alternatively, since we can recreate the dataset from the image, hereâ€™s a quick way:

students <- data.frame(
  height = c(181,160,174,170,172,165,161,167,139,166,162,158,175,181,180,177,173),
  shoesize = c(44,38,42,43,43,39,38,38,39,38,37,36,42,44,43,43,41),
  gender = c("male","female","female","male","male","female","female","female","female","female","female",
             "female","male","male","male","male","male"),
  population = c("kuopio","kuopio","kuopio","kuopio","kuopio","kuopio","kuopio","tampere","tampere","tampere",
                 "tampere","tampere","tampere","tampere","tampere","tampere","tampere"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)


-------------------------------------------------------

2. Check that R read the file correctly

head(students)
str(students)


-------------------------------------------

3. Print the column headers only

colnames(students)


---------------------------------------------

4. Mean height and shoe size

mean(students$height)
mean(students$shoesize)


----------------------------------------

5. Standard deviations

sd(students$height)
sd(students$shoesize)


-------------------------------------------

6. Gender distribution

table(students$gender)


--------------------------------------------

7. Check which individuals are males

students[students$gender == "male", ]


------------------------------------------------

8. Recode gender to "M" and "F"

students$gender_code <- ifelse(students$gender == "male", "M", "F")


-------------------------------------------------

9. Extract subset of males

males <- subset(students, gender_code == "M")
