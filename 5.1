Explain the missing value solutions used in the data cleaning process.
Missing value solutions include:

Deletion (removing rows or columns with missing data if they are few and non-critical)

Imputation (filling in missing values using methods like mean, median, mode, regression, or advanced models)

Flagging (marking missing values to treat them differently in analysis)
